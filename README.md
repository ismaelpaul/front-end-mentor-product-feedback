# Product feedback app - Frontend Mentor

![Design preview for the Product feedback app coding challenge](./src/assets/preview.jpg)

## Intro

Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my solution to the [Product feedback app challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6) from Frontend Mentor. ðŸ˜€

Feel free to look around and explore! ðŸ˜‰

## Overview

I went to the extra mile and build a full stack web app.

For the front end I used:

- TypeScript and React;
- Tailwind;
- Redux;
- Zod library for form validation.

For the back end I used:

- Node.js
- NestJS.js
- MongoDB.

As a user you can:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size;
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page;
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests;
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests;
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments;
- Filter suggestions by category;
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request;
- Upvote product feedback requests.
